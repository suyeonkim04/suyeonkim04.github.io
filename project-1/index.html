<h1> How are you <span class="really">(really)</span> feeling today? </h1>

<p>Welcome to the dictionary for your everyday thoughts!</p>

<p> 
    Ever found yourself caught in a strange, nameless feeling—one that lingers just beyond the edge of language? This website is an exploration of those emotions: the ones that drift through your mind like ghosts, too subtle to name but too powerful to ignore.
</p>

<p>
    Here, you'll find words for the unspoken—terms that capture everyday emotions you may have never been able to articulate. Whether it's the quiet ache of nostalgia, the odd satisfaction of a small but perfect moment, or the longing for something just out of reach, each word invites you into a deeper understanding of what it means to be human.
