    <h4> ringlorn </h4>
    <p>
        <i>adj.</i> the wish that the modern world felt as epic as the one depicted in old stories and folktales—a place of tragedy and transcendence, of oaths and omens and fates, where everyday life felt like a quest for glory, a mythic bond with an ancient past, or a battle for survival against a clear enemy, rather than an open-ended parlor game where all the rules are made up and the points don't matter.
        </p> 
        </b> 
        <p> From ring, a key element in many sagas and myths + -lorn, sorely missing. Pronounced "ring-lawrn."
        </p>

    <h4> slipfast </h4>
    <p>
        <i>adj.</i> longing to disappear completely; to melt into a crowd and become invisible, so you can take in the world without having to take part in it—free to wander through conversations without ever leaving footprints, free to dive deep into things without worrying about making a splash.
        </p> 
        <p> From slip, to move or fly away in secret + fast, fortified against attack.
